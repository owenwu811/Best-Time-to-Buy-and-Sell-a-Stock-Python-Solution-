Given a string s consisting only of characters a, b and c.

Return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters a, b and c.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabc"
Output: 10
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "abc", "abca", "abcab", "abcabc", "bca", "bcab", "bcabc", "cab", "cabc" and "abc" (again). 
Example 2:

Input: s = "aaacb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The substrings containing at least one occurrence of the characters a, b and c are "aaacb", "aacb" and "acb". 
Example 3:

Input: s = "abc"
Output: 1

Solution (Python):

class Solution:
    @staticmethod
    def numberOfSubstrings(s):
        count = 0 #result that we will eventually return
        freq = {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0} #dictionary containing all three of the possible characters 
        left = 0
        
        for right in range(len(s)):
            freq[s[right]] += 1
            
            while all(freq.values()):
                count += len(s) - right
                freq[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1
                
        return count
