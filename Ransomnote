Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

 

Example 1:

Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true

        ransomdict = {}
        magazinedict = {}
        for r in ransomNote:
            if r not in ransomdict:
                ransomdict[r] = 0
            ransomdict[r] += 1
        for m in magazine:
            if m not in magazinedict:
                magazinedict[m] = 0
            magazinedict[m] += 1
           
        for i, j in ransomdict.items(): #mistake was here. We want to compare the frequencies of characters in both dictionaries. if any char in ransomdict is higher, than it's not possible.
            if j > magazinedict.get(i, 0): #i represents the key (character) from ransomdict during each iteration of the loop while magazinedict.get is getting the VALUE of the I KEY in the magazinedict dictionary. the number of times a appears has to be exactly equal in both strings to be valid.
                return False
        return True

#you cannot use nested loops for 59 because that would compare every single pair in one dictionary with every single pair in the other dictionary, which we don't want.
