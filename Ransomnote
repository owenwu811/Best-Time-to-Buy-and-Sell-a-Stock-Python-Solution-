Given two strings ransomNote and magazine, return true if ransomNote can be constructed by using the letters from magazine and false otherwise.

Each letter in magazine can only be used once in ransomNote.

 

Example 1:

Input: ransomNote = "a", magazine = "b"
Output: false
Example 2:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "ab"
Output: false
Example 3:

Input: ransomNote = "aa", magazine = "aab"
Output: true

    def canConstruct(self, ransomNote: str, magazine: str) -> bool:
        ransomdict = {}
        magazinedict = {}
        for r in ransomNote:
            if r not in ransomdict:
                ransomdict[r] = 0
            ransomdict[r] += 1
        for m in magazine:
            if m not in magazinedict:
                magazinedict[m] = 0
            magazinedict[m] += 1
        for i, j in ransomdict.items(): #mistake was here. We want to compare the frequencies of characters in both dictionaries. if any char in ransomdict is higher, than it's not possible.
            if j > magazinedict.get(i, 0):
                return False
        return True
