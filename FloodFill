An image is represented by an m x n integer grid image where image[i][j] represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers sr, sc, and color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

 

Example 1:


Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, color = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
Explanation: From the center of the image with position (sr, sc) = (1, 1) (i.e., the red pixel), all pixels connected by a path of the same color as the starting pixel (i.e., the blue pixels) are colored with the new color.
Note the bottom corner is not colored 2, because it is not 4-directionally connected to the starting pixel.
Example 2:

Input: image = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]], sr = 0, sc = 0, color = 0
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]]
Explanation: The starting pixel is already colored 0, so no changes are made to the image.





Solution: 
#At the beginning, we want to find the starting square and replace that square's value with color as given by the variable in the problem
# What we want to do is essentially check that every square to the left right up or down is the same value as the starting square provided by image[sr][sc], and if it is, stop recursing, and if it's not, then replace that square with the value of color
# In other words, we keep recursing to the left right up down until the new square we are stepping onto is already the same color, and if it's the same color, we step back by coming back from the direction we came in
#at the end, we return the new image once the recursion stops and the base case is reached 
class Solution:
    def floodFill(self, image: List[List[int]], sr: int, sc: int, color: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        #ensures we stop flooding if the square to the left, right, up, or down is already the same number aka already flooded
        if image[sr][sc] == color:
            return image

        starting = image[sr][sc]
        # Call the fill function using the class name Solution

        self.fill(image, sr, sc, starting, color)      
        #return image only occurs when we terminate the base case aka the base case becomes true and we stop recursion
        return image
    # Add the self parameter to the fill function to make it a method of the Solution class
    def fill(self, image, row, col, original_color, color):
        #we have two conditions: don't go out of bounds in up down right left of grid and don't step onto a square that already has the same value
        #these are boundary checks
        if (row < 0 or row >= len(image)) or (col < 0 or col >= len(image[0])):
            return 
        
        if image[row][col] != original_color:
            return
        
        image[row][col] = color

        # Recursively fill the neighboring pixels in the four cardinal directions
        self.fill(image, row + 1, col, original_color, color)  # Down
        self.fill(image, row - 1, col, original_color, color)  # Up
        self.fill(image, row, col + 1, original_color, color)  # Right
        self.fill(image, row, col - 1, original_color, color)  # Left
