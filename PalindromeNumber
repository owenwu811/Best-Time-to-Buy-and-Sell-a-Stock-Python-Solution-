Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.


My Solution (Python3):


class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        x = str(x) #just convert to a string and iterate
        for i in range(len(x)):
            l = 0
            r = len(x) - 1
            while l < r:
                if x[l] != x[r]:
                    return False
                l += 1
                r -= 1
        return True
