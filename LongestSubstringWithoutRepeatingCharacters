Given a string s, find the length of the longest 
substring
 without repeating characters.


Example 1:

Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
Example 2:

Input: s = "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.
Example 3:

Input: s = "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
 

Constraints:

0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.


My Solution:

class Solution:
    import math
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        duplicatecheck = set()
        windowstart = 0 
        windowend = 0
        length = 0
        for windowend in range(len(s)): #we are expanding the window with the windowend pointer
            while s[windowend] in duplicatecheck: 
                duplicatecheck.remove(s[windowstart]) #if the windowend pointer we are about to add is already in the set, shrink the window by removing and incrementing left
                windowstart += 1
            duplicatecheck.add(s[windowend]) #if we don't have this, we can't use line 9 to determine if it's a duplicate or not because we're checking to see if it already exists in the set to determine if we need to shrink the window
            length = max(length, windowend - windowstart + 1) #update the maximum length of the valid window
        return length
