Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
Output: false

My Solution:

class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sdict = {}
        tdict = {}
        for i, j in enumerate(s):
            if j not in sdict:
                sdict[j] = 0 #we add the value as the key, which is the letter, and the count always starts at 0 and goes to 1 because we are adding the character for the first time, so we always increment by 1. This is also why we use a if instead of while here.
            sdict[j] += 1
        for x, y in enumerate(t):
            if y not in tdict:
                tdict[y] = 0
            tdict[y] += 1
        print(sorted(sdict)) #printing to make sure the dictionaries are what I want up to this point
        print(sorted(tdict))
        if sdict == tdict: #we want to compare the two dictionaries to make sure the count of each character is the same. Note that dictionary order dosen't matter.
        #If so, they are the same in different order. If not, then they have different characters
            return True
        else:
            return False

 class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        sdict = {}
        tdict = {}
        for i in s:
            if i not in sdict:
                sdict[i] = 0
            sdict[i] += 1
        for j in t:
            if j not in tdict: #must have not in tdict, not in tdict
                tdict[j] = 0
            tdict[j] += 1
        if sdict == tdict:
            return True
        else:
            return False
