#You are given a 0-indexed binary string s having an even length.

#A string is beautiful if it's possible to partition it into one or more substrings such that:

#Each substring has an even length.
#Each substring contains only 1's or only 0's.
#You can change any character in s to 0 or 1.

#Return the minimum number of changes required to make the string s beautiful.

 

#Example 1:

#Input: s = "1001"
#Output: 2
#Explanation: We change s[1] to 1 and s[3] to 0 to get string "1100".
#It can be seen that the string "1100" is beautiful because we can partition it into "11|00".
#It can be proven that 2 is the minimum number of changes needed to make the string beautiful.


#my own solution using python3 after looking at hint and looking at a solution:

class Solution:
    def minChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(1, len(s), 2):
            if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
                res += 1
        return res
